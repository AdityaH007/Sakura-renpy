 Project Title: Whispers of Sakura - Solo Ren'Py Adventure Prototype  Description:  Whispers of Sakura is my debut adventure game created using the Ren'Py visual novel engine. As a solo developer, I ventured into the realms of game development, experimenting with Ren'Py, AI image generation, and storytelling. This project represents a significant learning experience, and while the story might be a work in progress, the journey has been invaluable.  Key Features:  AI Image Generation: Leveraging AI for image generation to enhance visual elements within the game. Ren'Py Engine: A solo venture into the world of Ren'Py, exploring its capabilities for narrative game development. Story Prototype: While the story is a nascent attempt, it serves as a foundation for future improvements and iterations. How to Experience the Prototype:  Clone the repository to your local machine. Install the latest version of Ren'Py. Open the project in the Ren'Py development environment. Explore the prototype by running the game. Feedback and Contributions: This project is a learning journey, and feedback is greatly appreciated! If you have suggestions for improving the story or any other aspects, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaborations and insights from the community are welcome.  Lessons Learned:  The project served as my introduction to Ren'Py and game development. AI image generation was implemented for enhanced visual elements. Solo development offered insights into the challenges and joys of creating a game from start to finish.
